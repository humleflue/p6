# Getting started

This is the Simplicity Studio workspace directory. To open the "kin-neural-network" project:

- Open up Simplicity Studio
- Go to File -> Switch Workspace ...
- Click "Browse..." and select this (simplicity-studio-workspace-directory) directory
- If the Project Explorer does not automatically show in the left panel; click the "Open Perspective" button depicted by a small table view with a yellow plus on, which should be located in the top right of Simplicity Studio. Pick Simplicity IDE from the menu.
