Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presenting an SVM that is able to run on a low consumption device with simple data, rather than using external devices, thereby limiting the amount of ressources needed.
    \item Suggestion of a simple algorithm rather than complex deep learning algorithms to limit computational need
    \item Lowering power need for bluetooth broadcasting as only a classification and a timestamp is broadcasted per second rather than 36 datapoints corresponding to one second of measurements
    %\item A comparison of different approaches classifying activity by only analysing accelerometer data
    \item Grouping labels into super classes for better predictions as application domain (device to be fitted on) is unknown
\end{itemize}
