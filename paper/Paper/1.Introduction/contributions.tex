Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presenting an SVM \fxwarning{What it stands for?} that is able to run on a low consumption device with simple data, rather than using external devices, thereby limiting the amount of ressources needed. \fxwarning{It is not clearyl connected to introduction. Is the SVM a deep-learning method? }
    \item Suggestion of a simple algorithm rather than complex deep learning algorithms to limit computational need \fxwarning{Seems to be related to the previous one}
    \item Lowering power need for bluetooth broadcasting as only a classification and a timestamp is broadcasted per second rather than 36 datapoints \fxwarning{Too detailed, concepts are not introduced yet} corresponding to one second of measurements \fxwarning{How is this connected to the problem? Probably you need to mention something related to the broadcasting before proposing a solution }
    %\item A comparison of different approaches classifying activity by only analysing accelerometer data
    \item Grouping labels into super classes for better predictions as application domain (device to be fitted on) is unknown \fxwarning{It is not clear. Maybe you are defining a process to establish general states for the machine. How is that connected to the previous parts: deep learning model and low consumption?}
\end{itemize}
