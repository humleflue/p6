Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presenting an SVM that is able to run on a low consumption device with simple data, rather than using external devices, thereby limiting the amount of resources needed.
    %\item A comparison of different approaches classifying activity by only analyzing accelerometer data
    \item Grouping labels into super classes for better predictions as application domain (device to be fitted on) is unknown \fxwarning{It is not clear. Maybe you are defining a process to establish general states for the machine. How is that connected to the previous parts: deep learning model and low consumption?}
\end{itemize}
