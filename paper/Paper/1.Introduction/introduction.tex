In the 1990s scientists started using machine learning to analyze large amounts of data and draw conclusions from the results \cite{marr2016short}.
One of the issues with this, is that processing data at this scale requires a lot of computational power \cite{garcia2019estimation}, which means that devices with lower computational power will struggle to process the data in a timely manner.
This issue is amplified by the fact that high-level languages, which are large and complex, provide the best support for machine learning algorithms due to their large number of libraries \cite{top5mllangs}.
This could be a problem for low consumption devices, because computing power and battery life might be limited. This creates the question: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{Is it possible to run an embedded Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a low consumption device gaining a higher accuracy than a threshold?}
\end{center}
If you have a low consumption device, which has low computing power and limited battery capacity, running machine learning inference can be a demanding task on the device's hardware \cite{batterylifewearablesensors}. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate, if a machine learning algorithm can be embedded on a low consumption device, in order to reduce strain on the device's hardware.\\

% To be added:
% We broadcast limited amount of data as compared to 36 data points
% More complex model than threshold but still more simple than current methods using both gyroscopes, accelerometers, image recognition and/or complex models like RNN, DNN, CNN or a combination of them. We use only one data collection source and a simple algorithm

\fxwarning{Connect to the previous idea. For example, the device is capturing time series, so...}
Time series analysis is used in a variety of domains such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR) \cite{HumanActivityrecognitionAccelerometer}, construction activity recognition \cite{ConstructionRecognitionFractionalRandomForest}\cite{timeseriesDataAugmentationConstruction} and weather forecasting \cite{weatherForecastTimeSeries}.
The application of time series analysis in the construction industry has shown promising results on medium sized equipment such as excavators, lifts and trucks reaching accuracies above 96\% \cite{timeseriesDataAugmentationConstruction, constructionRecognitionMobileSensors,ConstructionRecognitionFractionalRandomForest} using augmentation, long short-term memory (LSTM) \cite{timeseriesDataAugmentationConstruction} support vector machines \cite{constructionRecognitionMobileSensors} and fractional random forest \cite{ConstructionRecognitionFractionalRandomForest}, however research in deep learning is limited in hardware-specific devices, because of the memory and processing demands \cite{deepLearningLowConsumptionStateOfTheArt}. Most of them are focus on heavy computation running on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) processors and therefore they cannot be directly applied on mobile and embedded devices \cite{deepLearningLowConsumptionStateOfTheArt}.
Measuring the movement of a small device such as a drill and classifying it can help identify how it is treated and identify specific patterns that leads to destruction or misuse. Identifying such patterns allows the industry to minimize deteriorating behavior, meaning that less resources are spent on checking, fixing and buying new equipment. If a $CO_2$ emitting device, such as a generator, is fitted with an accelerometer, tracking its activity can help reduce the amount of time it is in use and thereby reduce its emissions.\\ 
Other domains expand research of deep learning to low consumption devices such as HAR \cite{HumanActivityrecognitionAccelerometer, HARsignalprocessing, hybridHARSVMCNN} as these run deep learning on mobile or embedded devices. They all use accelerometers for data collection, which is advantageous because the accelerometer's compact size and low weight make it easier to fit on smaller devices like mobile or embedded devices, and it produces basic data with few features to evaluate, reducing processing need.
