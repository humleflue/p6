abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an exponential increase in the use of mobile and embedded devices. With the great success of deep learning in many fields, there is an emerging trend to deploy deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to better meet the requirement of real-time applications and user privacy protection. However, the limited resources of mobile and embedded devices make it challenging to fulfill the intensive computation and storage demand of deep learning models. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the related issues for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices. We start with a brief introduction of deep learning and discuss major challenges of implementing deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices. We then conduct an in-depth survey on important compression and acceleration techniques that help adapt deep learning models to mobile and embedded devices, which we specifically classify as pruning, quantization, model distillation, network design strategies, and low-rank factorization. We elaborate on the hardware-based solutions, including mobile GPU, FPGA, and ASIC, and describe software frameworks for mobile deep learning models, especially the development of frameworks based on OpenCL and RenderScript. After that, we present the application of mobile deep learning in a variety of areas, such as navigation, health, speech recognition, and information security. Finally, we discuss some future directions for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to inspire further research in this area.},

abstract = {In the construction industry, especially for civil infrastructure projects, a large portion of overall project expenses are allocated towards various costs associated with heavy equipment. As a result, continuous tracking and monitoring of tasks performed by construction heavy equipment is vital for project managers and jobsite personnel. The current approaches for automated construction equipment monitoring include both location and action tracking methods. Current construction equipment action recognition and tracking methods can be divided into two major categories: 1) using active sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes and 2) implementing computer vision algorithms to extract information by processing images and videos. While both categories have their own advantages, the limitations of each mean that the industry still suffers from the lack of an efficient and automatic solution for the construction equipment activity analysis problem. In this paper we propose an innovative audio-based system for activity analysis (and tracking) of construction heavy equipment. Such equipment usually generates distinct sound patterns while performing certain tasks, and hence audio signal processing could be an alternative solution for solving the activity analysis problem within construction jobsites. The proposed system consists of multiple steps including filtering the audio signals, converting them into time-frequency representations, classifying these representations using machine learning techniques (e.g., a support vector machine), and window filtering the output of the classifier to differentiating between different patterns of activities. The proposed audio-based system has been implemented and evaluated using multiple case studies from several construction jobsites and the results demonstrate the potential capabilities of the system in accurately recognizing various actions of construction heavy equipment.}
