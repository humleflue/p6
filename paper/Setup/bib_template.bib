%%%% Guide for bibtex and mybib.bib %%%%

% All sources are cited with the IEEE citation style, and in the report all citations will look like this: [1]
% In the text you cite with the command \cite{keyName}
% To cite a specific page use the command \cite[32]{keyName}

% Below examples of source notation will be found:
    % - Book is used for ORDINARY BOOKS
    % - Article is used for ARTICLES and PUBLICATIONS
    % - Techreport is used for SMALLER PUBLICATIONS if only title, author and year is necessary/available
    % - Misc (1st use case) is used for WEBSITES
    % - Misc (2nd use case) is used for other categories which don't fall into any of the above categories eg. INTERVIEWS and LECTURES

% If there's MORE THAN ONE AUTHOR in one source, THEY HAVE TO be listed with "and" separating the authors - also in the case of 3 or more authors. For example: 
    % author = {Arne Andersen and Beathe Bendtsen and Charlie Chaplin}
    % In the report the above example will look like this: Arne Andersen, Beathe Bendtsen and Charlie Chaplin
% If the AUTHOR IS A COMPANY encapsulate it with two curly braces on each side of the company's name. For example:
    % author = {{WikiLeaks}}
